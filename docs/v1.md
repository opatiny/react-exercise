## Making an usable app out of the tutorial code

### Storing data

[Local Storage tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-complete-guide-to-using-localstorage-in-javascript-apps-ba44edb53a36/)

It is possible to store data on a user's browser (approx 5Mb per web page). The page can be closed, or accessed from a different device and the data will be recovered. This is called "local storage". It is possible to inspect it from the js console, under "Application" -> "Local Storage".

We use two functions, to read and write data to the local storage: `.setIdem()` and `.getItem()`. The data in local storage is organized as an object. Each entry has a key and a value, which must be a string. In our case, we want to store a JSON, so we have to stringify it after reading, and parse it before writing it to the local storage.

#### Reading data
```js
const rawState = window.localStorage.getItem('data');
const parsedState = JSON.parse(rawState);
```

#### Writing data
```js
window.localStorage.setItem('data', JSON.stringify(this.state));
```
### Building

Once the code is working, you have to build it to make it stand-alone and usable by others.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running the build

The package `serve` was installed globally, it allows to run the build folder with:

```bash
serve -s build
```
