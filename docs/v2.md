# To Do List v2.0.0

Adapting the project to work with React Hooks.

## Packages added in v2

- `reactstrap`: React layout components (dropdown, popover)

## Global definition of Hook

Apparently, hooks allow you to replace all the function that act on the state. For instance, `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, `setState()`, ...

## Effect Hook

In our case, this hook will replace `componentDidMount()`and `componentDidUpdate()`. It is executed after any changes are made to the DOM.
